# CSS Project-Based Tasks

Below are project-style tasks to practice selectors, the box model, backgrounds, and pseudo-classes/elements. Complete each by creating a small HTML/CSS example.

1. Create a profile card that shows your name, role, and a short bio. Use class and id selectors for styling.
2. Design a navigation bar with three links (Home, About, Contact). Add a hover effect using the `:hover` pseudo-class.
3. Create a list of features inside a `<div>`. Use the child selector (`>`) to style only the direct `<li>` elements.
4. Build a login form with username and password fields. Style inputs differently using attribute selectors like `input[type="text"]` and `input[type="password"]`.
5. Create a box with padding, border, and margin. In CSS comments, explain how each property affects spacing.
6. Make a background section with an image and text on top. Use `background-size: cover` and `background-position: center`.
7. Add a button and use `:hover` and `:active` pseudo-classes to give it an animation or color effect.
8. Create a heading that has a star (‚≠ê) before and after it using pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`).
9. Create a simple pricing card layout (3 columns). Each card should have a title, price, and button. Add a hover effect to scale up the card slightly.
